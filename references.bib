Inmon's Building the Data Warehouse has become the bible of data warehousing -- the first and best introduction to the subject. A lot has changed in data warehousing technology since the last edition appeared in 1996, and this latest volume is completely revised to reflect exciting new techniques and applications, update existing topics, and examine data marts, operational data stores, and the corporate information factory. In this Third Edition, Inmon explains what a data warehouse is (and isn't), why it's needed, how it works, and how the traditional data warehouse can be integrated with new technologies, including the Web, to provide enhanced customer service and support. He also addresses the trade-offs between normalized data warehouses and dimensional data marts.},
