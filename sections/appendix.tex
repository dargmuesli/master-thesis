\section{Cultural Dimension Comparison: Germany and Japan}
\label{sec:appendix-country-comparison-tool-descriptions}

The following paragraphs are excerpts from the Country Comparison tool, visualized in \cref{fig:country-comparison}.

\begin{enumerate}
%     \item \ac{pdi}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Germany}
%         Highly decentralised and supported by a strong middle class, Germany is not surprisingly among the lower power distant countries (score 35).
%         Co-determination rights are comparatively extensive and have to be taken into account by the management.
%         A direct and participative communication and meeting style is common, control is disliked and leadership is challenged to show expertise and best accepted when it's based on it.
% % old dependency versions in Japan
%         \item \textbf{Japan}
%         At an intermediate score of 54, Japan is a borderline hierarchical society.
%         Yes, Japanese are always conscious of their hierarchical position in any social setting and act accordingly.
%         However, it is not as hierarchical as most of the other Asian cultures.
%         Some foreigners experience Japan as extremely hierarchical because of their business experience of painstakingly slow decision making process: all the decisions must be confirmed by each hierarchical layer and finally by the top management in Tokyo.
%         Paradoxically, the exact example of their slow decision making process shows that in Japanese society there is no one top guy who can take decision like in more hierarchical societies.
%         Another example of not so high Power Distance is that Japan has always been a meritocratic society.
%         There is a strong notion in the Japanese education system that everybody is born equal and anyone can get ahead and become anything if he (yes, it is still he) works hard enough.
%     \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{idv}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Germany}
        The German society is a truly Individualist one (79).
        Small families with a focus on the parent-children relationship rather than aunts and uncles are most common.
        There is a strong belief in the ideal of self-actualization.
        Loyalty is based on personal preferences for people as well as a sense of duty and responsibility.
        This is defined by the contract between the employer and the employee.
        Communication is among the most direct in the world following the ideal to be “honest, even if it hurts” – and by this giving the counterpart a fair chance to learn from mistakes.

        \item \textbf{Japan}
        Japan scores 62 on the Individualism dimension.
        Japanese society shows the characteristics of an individualistic society.
        Japanese society does not have an extended family system like China and Korea.
        Japan has been a paternalistic society and the family name and asset was inherited from the father to the eldest son.
        The younger siblings had to leave home and make their living with their core families.
        Japanese are famous for their loyalty to their companies, which people have chosen for themselves, which is an Individualist thing to do.
        You could say that the Japanese in-group is situational.
        Japanese are more private and reserved than most other Asians.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{mas}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Germany}
        With a score of 66 Germany is considered a Decisive society.
        Performance is highly valued and early required as the school system separates children into different types of schools at the age of ten.
        People rather “live in order to work” and draw a lot of self-esteem from their tasks.
        Managers are expected to be decisive and assertive.
        Status is often shown, especially by cars, watches, and technical devices.

        \item \textbf{Japan}
        At 95, Japan is one of the most Decisive societies in the world.
        However, in combination with their mild collectivism, you do not see assertive and competitive individual behaviors which we often associate with a Decisive culture.
        What you see is severe competition between groups.
        From a very young age at kindergartens, children learn to compete on sports day for their groups (traditionally red team against white team).
        In corporate Japan, you see that employees are most motivated when they are fighting in a winning team against their competitors.
        What you also see as an expression of Decisiveness in Japan is the drive for excellence and perfection in their material production (monodukuri) and in material services (hotels and restaurants) and presentation (gift wrapping and food presentation) in every aspect of life.
        Notorious Japanese workaholism is another expression of their Decisiveness.
        It is still hard for women to climb up the corporate ladders in Japan with their Decisive norm of hard and long working hours.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{uai}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Germany}
        Germany is among the uncertainty avoidant countries (65); the score is on the high end, so there is a slight preference for Uncertainty Avoidance.
        In line with the philosophical heritage of Kant, Hegel and Fichte there is a strong preference for deductive rather than inductive approaches, be it in thinking, presenting or planning: the systematic overview has to be given in order to proceed.
        This is also reflected by the law system.
        Details are equally important to create certainty that a certain topic or project is well-thought-out.
        In combination with their low Power Distance, where the certainty for own decisions is not covered by the larger responsibility of the boss, Germans prefer to compensate for their higher uncertainty by strongly relying on expertise.

        \item \textbf{Japan}
        At 92 Japan is one of the most uncertainty avoiding countries on earth.
        This is often attributed to the fact that Japan is constantly threatened by natural disasters from earthquakes, tsunamis (this is a Japanese word used internationally), typhoons to volcano eruptions.
        Under these circumstances Japanese learned to prepare themselves for any uncertain situation.
        This goes not only for the emergency plan and precautions for sudden natural disasters but also for every other aspects of society.
        You could say that in Japan anything you do is prescribed for maximum predictability.
        From cradle to grave, life is highly ritualized and you have a lot of ceremonies.
        For example, there is opening and closing ceremonies of every school year which are conducted almost exactly the same way everywhere in Japan.
        At weddings, funerals and other important social events, what people wear and how people should behave are prescribed in great detail in etiquette books.
        School teachers and public servants are reluctant to do things without precedence.
        In corporate Japan, a lot of time and effort is put into feasibility studies and all the risk factors must be worked out before any project can start.
        Managers ask for all the detailed facts and figures before taking any decision.
        This high need for Uncertainty Avoidance is one of the reasons why changes are so difficult to realize in Japan.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{lto}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Germany}
        Germany's score of 57 indicates that it is a pragmatic country.
        In societies with a pragmatic orientation, people believe that truth depends very much on situation, context, and time.
        They show an ability to adapt traditions easily to changed conditions, a strong propensity to save and invest, thriftiness, and perseverance in achieving results.

        \item \textbf{Japan}
        At 100 Japan scores the most Long Term Orientation oriented societies.
        Japanese see their life as a very short moment in the long history of mankind.
        From this perspective, some kind of fatalism is not strange to the Japanese.
        You do your best in your lifetime and that is all that you can do.
        The notion of the one and only almighty God is not familiar to the Japanese.
        People live their lives guided by virtues and practical good examples.
        In corporate Japan, you see long-term orientation in the constantly high rate of investment in R\&D even in economically difficult times, higher own capital rate, priority to steady growth of market share rather than to a quarterly profit, and so on.
        They all serve the durability of the companies.
        The idea behind it is that the companies are not here to make money every quarter for the shareholders but to serve the stakeholders and society at large for many generations to come (e.g. Matsuhista).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \ac{ind}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Germany}
        The low score of 40 on this dimension indicates that the German culture is Restrained in nature.
        Societies with a low score in this dimension have a tendency to cynicism and pessimism.
        Also, in contrast to Indulgent societies, Restrained societies do not put much emphasis on leisure time and control the gratification of their desires.
        People with this orientation have the perception that their actions are Restrained by social norms and feel that indulging themselves is somewhat wrong.

        \item \textbf{Japan}
        Japan, with a low score of 42, is shown to have a culture of Restraint.
        Societies with a low score in this dimension have a tendency to cynicism and pessimism.
        Also, in contrast to Indulgent societies, Restrained societies do not put much emphasis on leisure time and control the gratification of their desires.
        People with this orientation have the perception that their actions are Restrained by social norms and feel that indulging themselves is somewhat wrong.

\section{Local Kubernetes}
\label{sec:appendix-kubernetes}

Several Kubernetes distributions and virtualization environments support running Kubernetes locally.
\href{https://k3s.io/}{\textit{k3s}}, a certified Kubernetes distribution, is tailored for resource-constrained environments, which suits development contexts as opposed to multi-server production environments.
k3s can also run in Docker via a wrapper named \href{https://k3d.io/}{\textit{k3d}}.
The following command sets up a cluster with four namespaces in Kubernetes and a \href{https://traefik.io/traefik/}{\textit{Traefik}} ingress for external access to services:

\mint{sh}|k3d cluster create lakehouse|

Using the Kubernetes \ac{cli} \texttt{kubectl} and \href{https://helm.sh/}{\textit{Helm}} as the Kubernetes package manager, the installation of Longhorn (shown in \cref{lst:longhorn-setup}) fails.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}{sh}
helm repo add longhorn https://charts.longhorn.io
helm repo update
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system --create-namespace
\end{minted}
\caption{Longhorn setup for Kubernetes using Helm.}
\label{lst:longhorn-setup}
\end{listing}

The issue arises because Longhorn relies on \ac{iscsi}, a protocol for connections and data transfers between computers and peripheral devices over \ac{tcp}, ``which cannot be installed in the standard k3s image, as it would have to use an OS base image''~\cite{Rizzi2021}.
According to a comment on the relevant feature request in k3d's \href{https://github.com/}{\textit{GitHub}} repository, creating a custom container image with a non-\texttt{scratch} OS base could resolve the issue.
However, this would be overly complex for our current needs.

Another local Kubernetes implementation is \href{https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io}{\textit{minikube}}, which can run on various drivers, including Docker and \acp{vm}.
To install the necessary \ac{iscsi} dependencies on an \ac{os}, we use the \ac{vm} driver as shown in \cref{lst:minikube-setup}.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}{sh}
minikube start --driver=kvm2
minikube node add --worker
minikube ssh "sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install -y open-iscsi"
\end{minted}
\caption{Minikube setup using the VM driver.}
\label{lst:minikube-setup}
\end{listing}

Even though it is possible to install an \ac{iscsi} implementation, the service does not start, as \ac{iscsi} is also unsupported in minikube~\cite{Deutsch2017}.

The third and last option tested for a local Kubernetes setup was to use Rancher to create a Kubernetes cluster on Linux \acp{vm}.
Installing \texttt{open-iscsi} as above and deploying Longhorn through the Rancher \ac{gui} was initially successful.
However, issues arise when the cluster nodes reinitialize their availability, such as after waking from system hibernation, as Rancher becomes stuck waiting for the nodes to reconnect due to an ongoing bug~\cite{Henkens2023}.
This bug, opened in 2023, has since been closed due to inactivity.
